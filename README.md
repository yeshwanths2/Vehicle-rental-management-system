VEHICLE RENTAL MANAGMENT SYSTEM

Ever wonder how a backend system works or how an admin manages everything behind the scenes? 

By using the topic of VEHICLE RENT we created a complete backed interface of an admin.


This project showcases the ability to develop complex backend systems and create efficient administrative tools. By focusing on the complete backend process without using customer friendly frontend tool like HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT integration, we illustrate how vehicles can be effectively managed and demonstrate how the backend works and how administrators can manage various aspects of the operation.


I am excited to share my new project, the Vehicle Rental Management System, built using JAVA for the backend in NetBeans and My SQL for the database, with a user-friendly GUI(Graphical-user interface) for the frontend.  Below is a detailed overview of its functionalities:

2. Add new vehicles (cars and bikes) with detailed information including availability and pricing.

3. Add and manage drivers, assigning them to vehicle bookings based on availability and per-day payment.
